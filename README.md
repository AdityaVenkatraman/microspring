# Dataset description
This is the repository for the Materials and Design paper titled "Texture-Sensitive Prediction of Micro-Spring Performance Using Gaussian Process Models Calibrated to Finite Element Simulations"
* There are separate datasets for the textures and elastic constants
* For the textures
  * Training set textures (440) and test set textures (22) are present in **texture.hdf5**
* For the elastic constants
  * Training set elastic constants (440) and test set textures (5) are present in **elastic-constants.mat**
